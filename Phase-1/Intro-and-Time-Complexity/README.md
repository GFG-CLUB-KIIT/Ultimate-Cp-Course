## Introduction to Competitive Programming
------------------------------------------------

### -What's Competitive Programming ?

Competitive programming is a art form. It’s creative problem-solving at its finest, a combination of hard analytical thinking and creativity.
Competitive programmers use their knowledge of algorithms and data structures and logical reasoning skills to solve challenging algorithmic problems in a limited time frame.
Java and C++ are extremely popular due to their relative run-time efficiency compared to a language like Python. C++ is the preferred competitive programming language, as due to its Standard Template Library (STL) which allows for quick write ups of solutions.

### -Why Competitive Programming and DSA ?
The standard coding interview has much in common with a programming competition. They both require solving a clearly-defined programming puzzle, tend to focus on well-known algorithms rather than domain-specific technologies, and reward quick solutions. There are also some differences. In a programming competition, you have access to a computer, while in an interview, you will generally be coding on a whiteboard. Competition problems tend to be harder, especially once you have some experience. And online judges don’t require you to explain _why_ your solution works. But the key point is that experienced competitive programmers will find the coding part of an interview, a dreaded experience for most developers, to be rather straightforward.
